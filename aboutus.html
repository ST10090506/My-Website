    <p class="white-text">
        <strong>What We Do:</strong>
        <br>
        Lifeline is an enthusiastic and forward-thinking non-governmental organization (NGO) that is dedicated to
        enhancing healthcare services, offering relief to those in need, and spreading health education to disadvantaged
        groups. We were established with the goal of creating a healthier society, and we work to close healthcare gaps,
        get rid of diseases that can be avoided, and provide people the tools they need to take control of their health.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Our Focus Areas</strong>
        <br>
    <ol type="1">
        <li class="white-text">Access to Healthcare: We make every effort to make sure that healthcare services are
            available to everyone in the community. To serve individuals who are frequently left behind, our operations
            are centered on giving medical aid, creating health centers, and supporting rural locations with mobile
            clinics.</li>
        <li class="white-text">Health Education: Information is the basis for both preventing illnesses and encouraging
            healthy lifestyle choices. We seek to provide people with the knowledge they need to make wise decisions
            about their health through interactive workshops, seminars, and awareness campaigns.</li>
        <li class="white-text">Women's and children's health: Because women and children are the foundation of any
            healthy community, we are committed to preserving their health. Our initiatives place a strong emphasis on
            maternal wellness, prenatal care, dietary guidance, and vaccine access.</li>
        <li class="white-text">Disease Prevention: Preventable illnesses can have a profound impact on one's life, but
            they can also be avoided. To lower the prevalence of diseases that may be prevented, our team works
            carefully to develop vaccination drives, cleanliness programs, and awareness campaigns.</li>
